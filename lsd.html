Other Information:
~ LSD is a very potent psychedelic, known for its stimulating effects and visual hallucinations. It is very commonly taken at parties or raves due to its music enhancement effects. It got popular in the 1960s through its association with the counterculture movement of the time and eventually media talked positively and negatively about it. It's usually consumed on designed paper tabs about ¼" in size. Some people use liquid LSD through droppers as well but it's less common. Higher and heroic doses can be risky due to the mental intensity of the trip, with things like bad trips, extreme confusion, and loss of self and reality. 
**OTHER DRUGS ARE RARE TO FIND IN LSD BUT THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES OF OVERDOSE ON 25I-NBOMBe BEING MISLABELLED. IF YOUR LSD TASTES LIKE ANYTHING, DON'T TAKE IT.** 

Substance Mixing:

Dangerous/Avoid:
~ Some antidepressants, especially SSRIS are dangerous to mix with LSD due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.        
Examples: Fluoxetine, Sertraline, and Venlafaxine
~ Most other stimulating drugs should not be mixed with LSD due to the cardiovascular stress that can be put on the body, leading to long term heart issues, it can also be fatal.
Examples: Cocaine, Amphetamines (Adderall, Meth) and even caffeine (In high doses)

Safe/Caution
~ Cannabis products can be safely mixed with LSD, not causing any potential risks aside from possible paranoia or intensity, calming effects are more common though.
Examples: Weed
~ Other psychedelics are generally completely safe to mix with LSD, with there being absolutely no harmful side effects, but there is a significantly increased chance of being overwhelmed or stressed out by the trip, likely leading to a bad one, just be cautious. (And generally with LSD most drugs are safe to mix with it)
Examples: Psilocybin Mushrooms, 2C-B, Peyote
~ Empathogens like MDMA are pretty compatible as long as you don't take too high of a dose and have too intense of a trip, but some other empathogens require careful dosing and caution to avoid serotonin syndrome which can be fatal.
Examples: MDMA, MDA, 6-APB, Methylone
~ High dose dissociatives can be risky with LSD due to the confusion, intensity and possible lack of motor control. Most dissociatives are fine, especially in lower or moderate doses but higher doses could cause negative effects.
Examples: DXM, PCP, High Dose Ketamine
