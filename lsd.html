    <h2>Other Information</h2>
    <p>LSD is a very potent psychedelic, known for its stimulating effects and visual hallucinations. It is very commonly taken at parties or raves due to its music enhancement effects. It got popular in the 1960s through its association with the counterculture movement of the time and eventually media talked positively and negatively about it. It's usually consumed on designed paper tabs about ¼" in size. Some people use liquid LSD through droppers as well but it's less common. Higher and Heroic doses can be risky due to the mental intensity of the trip, with things like bad trips, extreme confusion, and loss of self and reality.</p>
