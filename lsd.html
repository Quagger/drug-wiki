  <h2>Other Information:</h2>
  <p>
    LSD is a very potent psychedelic, known for its stimulating effects and visual hallucinations.
    It is very commonly taken at parties or raves due to its music enhancement effects.
    It got popular in the 1960s through its association with the counterculture movement of the time
    and eventually media talked positively and negatively about it.
    It's usually consumed on designed paper tabs about ¼" in size. Some people use liquid LSD through
    droppers as well but it's less common. Higher and Heroic doses can be risky due to the mental intensity
    of the trip, with things like bad trips, extreme confusion, and loss of self and reality.

  <h2>Substance Mixing:</h2>

  <h3>Dangerous / Avoid:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Some antidepressants, especially SSRIs, are dangerous to mix with LSD due to the risk of <strong>serotonin syndrome</strong>.
      <br><em>Examples: Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Venlafaxine</em>
    </li>
    <li>Most other stimulating drugs should not be mixed with LSD due to cardiovascular stress, possible heart issues, or fatal complications.
      <br><em>Examples: Cocaine, Amphetamines (Adderall, Meth), high-dose Caffeine</em>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Safe / Caution:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cannabis products are generally safe with LSD, though they may increase intensity or paranoia. Calming effects are more common.
      <br><em>Examples: Weed</em>
    </li>
    <li>Other psychedelics are physically safe to mix with LSD, but greatly increase the mental intensity and risk of a bad trip.
      <br><em>Examples: Psilocybin Mushrooms, 2C-B, Peyote</em>
    </li>
    <li>Empathogens like MDMA can work well in moderation, but too much can raise serotonin syndrome risk.
      <br><em>Examples: MDMA, MDA, 6-APB, Methylone</em>
    </li>
    <li>High dose dissociatives can cause confusion or loss of control. Moderate doses are generally fine.
      <br><em>Examples: DXM, PCP, High Dose Ketamine</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
