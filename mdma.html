    <h2>Other Information</h2>
    <p>MDMA is a powerful stimulant that usually makes people want to socialize, making it a really popular choice as a party drug. MDMA comes in different forms but the most common are pills and powder, pills being orally ingested, and powder being insufflated. While rolling you can feel hot or dehydrated so make sure to drink water but not too much. Comedowns are difficult and usually a hard depressive crash. Due to the large amounts of serotonin MDMA releases, it's recommended to only take Molly every 4 ~ 6+ weeks to stay at healthy serotonin levels.</p>
    <p><strong>MDMA IS FREQUENTLY UNPURE AND USUALLY CONTAINS SMALL AMOUNTS OF OTHER SUBSTANCES LIKE OPIODS OR METHAMPHETAMINE</strong></p>

    <h2>Substance Mixing</h2>
    <h3>Dangerous/Avoid</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Most antidepressants can block the effects of MDMA or cause serotonin syndrome which can be fatal. Examples: Fluoxetine, Sertraline, and Venlafaxine</li>
      <li>Most other stimulating drugs should not be mixed with MDMA due to the stress that can be put on the heart, leading to heart issues and fatality. Examples: Cocaine, Amphetamines (Adderall, Meth) and even caffeine (In high doses)</li>
      <li>Other empathogens similar to MDMA like MDA can't be mixed due to the risk of neurotoxicity and the possibility of serotonin syndrome. Examples: MDA, 6-APB, MBDB, Ethylone/Methylone</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Safe/Caution</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cannabis products can be safely mixed with MDMA, not causing any potential risks aside from possible paranoia or intensity. Examples: Weed</li>
      <li>Psychedelics are generally very safe to mix with MDMA, with there being absolutely no harmful side effects, the only risks are intensity or paranoia, especially in higher doses of psychedelics, make sure to use caution and have experience for these. Examples: LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms, 2C-B, Peyote</li>
      <li>Benzodiazepines are for the most part safe on MDMA, but are usually used for the comedown or any anxiety you might have on MDMA, they generally aren't used to enhance a roll. Examples: Xanax, Ativan, Benzos</li>
    </ul>
