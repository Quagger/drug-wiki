    <p>A class of hallucinogens known for altering perception, thought, and mood.</p>

    <ul>
      <li> Most Psychedelics are known for being emotional and natural in some way, some types like <a href="mushrooms.html" class="underline"> Psilocybin mushrooms</a> are especially known to have deeper emotional trips. Others like <a href="lsd.html" class="underline">LSD</a> are more inclined to be solely used for recreation and fun. At the opposite end of that, there is <a href="dmt.html" class="underline">DMT which is usually an extremely intense spiritual experience. The types of visuals you might see generally vary by substance, with Mushrooms being more natural and mystical, LSD being more structured and things like DMT can completely overwhelm you (talking to Gods and entities isn't uncommon on DMT).
