      <li> Most Psychedelics are known for being emotional and natural in some way, some types like <a href="mushrooms.html" class="underline"> Psilocybin mushrooms</a> are especially known to have deeper emotional trips. Others like LSD are more inclined to be solely used for recreation and fun. At the opposite end of that, there is DMT which is usually an extremely intense spiritual experience.
